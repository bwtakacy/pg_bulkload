pg_bulkload
===========

This is an alternative repository of pg_bulkload.

Though the original CVS repository  is well-known, I feel easy to use GIT to daily develop.
The release of tar balls and RPMs is on pgfoundry :http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgbulkload .

-----------
The maintenance branch is VERSION3_1_STABLE. This branch supports PostgreSQL 8.4 to 9.4.
